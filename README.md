</p>

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the planned migration of the POSC community from our current communication platforms to a more structured, developer-friendly ecosystem centered around GitHub. This transition will occur gradually over a 12-18 month period to ensure minimal disruption to our community.

**Current State**: Primary communication on QQ group

**Target State**: **GitHub** as core collaboration hub + **Telegram** for real-time discussion

**Migration Principle**: Value-driven, gradual transition, community-focused

**Timeline**: Q3 2025 - Q1 2027

## ü§î Why We Are Migrating

Our current platform has served us well, but as our community grows and becomes more technical, we face several limitations:

| Aspect | Current Platform (QQ) | New Platform (GitHub + Telegram) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge Preservation** | ‚ùå Messages get lost, valuable content disappears | ‚úÖ **Discussions**, **Wiki**, and **READMEs** create permanent knowledge base |
| **Technical Collaboration** | ‚ùå Difficult to track issues, manage features, or review code | ‚úÖ **Issues & Projects** provide professional task management tools |
| **Openness & Transparency** | ‚ùå Relatively closed ecosystem, hard for newcomers to follow | ‚úÖ Built for open collaboration, attracting more developers |
| **Code Integration** | ‚ùå Completely separate from code repositories | ‚úÖ Native integration with Git repositories and CI/CD pipelines |
| **Automation** | ‚ùå Limited automation capabilities | ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** enable powerful workflow automation |
| **Community Discovery** | ‚ùå Hard for new members to find and evaluate our community | ‚úÖ GitHub provides discoverability through stars, forks, and contributions |

**In short, this migration is about upgrading our collaboration from "chat" to "action" and building a more sustainable foundation for our growing community.**

## üóìÔ∏è Migration Phase Plan (2024-2025)

The migration will occur in phases to ensure community members have adequate time to adapt. **The QQ group will remain active throughout phases 1 and 2 as a backup notification channel.**

### Phase 1: Foundation & Parallel Run (Q2-Q4 2025)
- **Objective**: Establish new platforms, create initial workflows, attract early adopters
- **Key Actions**:
  - [x] Create GitHub Organization and core repositories
  - [x] Develop comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md` documentation
  - [ ] Set up **GitHub Discussions** for Q&A and idea discussion
  - [ ] Establish **Telegram group** for real-time communication (link in QQ bio)
  - [ ] Migrate all existing documentation to GitHub Wiki
  - [ ] Pin new platform links in QQ group announcement
- **Community Impact**: Minimal changes. QQ remains primary; members encouraged to explore new platforms.

### Phase 2: Active Transition & Habit Building (Q1-Q3 2025)
- **Objective**: Shift core collaboration to GitHub, reduce reliance on QQ
- **Key Actions**:
  - [ ] All project tasks, feature discussions, and bug reports **must** use GitHub Issues
  - [ ] All official announcements **first** published on GitHub Releases/Discussions
  - [ ] Meeting notes, technical documents archived in relevant repositories
  - [ ] QQ group primarily used for announcements and redirecting to GitHub
  - [ ] Regular "office hours" on Telegram for real-time help
- **Community Impact**: Active members should be using GitHub daily; QQ becomes secondary channel.

### Phase 3: Finalization & New Normal (Q4 2025)
- **Objective**: Complete migration, archive QQ group as read-only
- **Key Actions**:
  - [ ] Assess community activity to confirm successful migration
  - [ ] Post final archival notice in QQ group
  - [ ] Set QQ group to "read-only" mode or maintain as backup channel
  - [ ] All new members directly onboarded to GitHub and Telegram
- **Community Impact**: **GitHub becomes primary platform;** QQ group archived.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
